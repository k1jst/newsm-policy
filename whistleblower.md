# Whistleblower Protection

>No one should face retaliation or unfair consequences for raising concerns suspecting or alleging fraud, discrimination, or any violation of law, policy, or procedure so long as they have reasonable grounds to justify them.

Everyone involved in the New England Wireless and Steam Museum mst observe high standards of business and personal ethics in the conduct of their duties and responsibilities. As volunteers, employees and representatives of the Museum, we must practice honesty and integrity in fulfilling our responsibilities and comply with all applicable laws and regulations.

## Reporting Responsibility
This Whistleblower Policy is intended to encourage and enable employees, volunteers, and others to raise serious concerns internally so that the Museum can address and correct inappropriate conduct and actions. It is the responsibility of all board members, officers, employees and volunteers to report concerns about violations of the Museum’s code of ethics or suspected violations of law or regulations that govern Museum operations.

## No Retaliation
It is contrary to the values of the Museum for anyone to retaliate against any board member, officer, employee or volunteer who in good faith reports an ethics violation, or a suspected violation of law, such as a complaint of discrimination, or suspected fraud, or suspected violation of any regulation governing the operations of the Museum. An employee who retaliates against someone who has reported a violation in good faith is subject to discipline up to and including termination of employment.

## Reporting Procedure

The Museum has an open door policy and suggests that employees and volunteers share their questions, concerns, suggestions or complaints with their supervisor. If you are not comfortable speaking with your supervisor or you are not satisfied with your supervisor’s response, you are encouraged to speak with the Executive Director. Supervisors and managers are required to report complaints or concerns about suspected ethical and legal violations in writing to the Executive Director, who has the responsibility to investigate all reported complaints. 

# Compliance Officer
The Executive Director is responsible for ensuring that all complaints about unethical or illegal conduct are investigated and resolved. The Executive Director or their designee, herafter the Compliance Officer, will advise the Board of Directors of all complaints and their resolution and will report at least annually to the Treasurer on compliance activity relating to accounting or alleged financial improprieties. 

# Accounting and Auditing Matters
The Museum's Executive Director shall immediately notify the Audit Committee/Finance Committee of any concerns or complaint regarding corporate accounting practices, internal controls or auditing and work with the committee until the matter is resolved.

# Acting in Good Faith
It will be assumed than anyone filing a written complaint concerning a violation or suspected violation is acting in good faith and has reasonable grounds for believing the information disclosed indicates a violation. Any allegations that prove not to be substantiated and which prove to have been made maliciously or knowingly to be false will be viewed as a serious disciplinary offense.

# Confidentiality
Violations or suspected violations may be submitted on a confidential basis by the complainant. Reports of violations or suspected violations will be kept confidential to the extent possible, consistent with the need to conduct an adequate investigation.

# Handling of Reported Violations
The Museum’s Compliance Officer will notify the person who submitted a complaint and acknowledge receipt of the reported violation or suspected violation. All reports will be promptly investigated and appropriate corrective action will be taken if warranted by the investigation.
